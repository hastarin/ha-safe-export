## Project: Home Assistant Battery Export Predictor

You are working on a system that predicts how much energy can be safely exported from a home battery during the 6–9pm peak period each evening, while ensuring sufficient charge remains to carry the home through to 11am the following day.

Installation-specific configuration (battery capacity, sensor names, provider history, absence periods) lives in `config/config.yaml` (gitignored). The example template is `config/config.example.yaml`.

## Current phase

**Phase 2: Modelling.** Phase 1 (data extraction) is complete — `src/extract.py` builds the dataset SQLite DB and all three validation fixtures pass. Phase 2 trains a model that produces the safe-export prediction defined in `docs/SPEC.md`.

Phase 3 (Home Assistant integration) comes after Phase 2. The dataset DB is the contract between Phase 1 and Phase 2; the trained model + `predict()` function is the contract between Phase 2 and Phase 3.

## Read these before writing code

- `docs/SPEC.md` — what we're predicting and the success criteria
- `docs/DATASET.md` — **the canonical data spec.** Sensor mappings, window definitions, column formulas, validation samples
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — why each design choice was made (do not "improve" these without strong justification and discussion)
- `docs/analysis/` — background analysis docs useful for modelling context: `ENERGY_ANALYSIS.md` (three-zone model selection rationale, statistical findings) and `PHASE_1_SCHEMA_UPDATE.md` (sensor coverage and schema evolution log)

## Critical gotchas

These will cost hours to rediscover. Trust them.

### 1. The HA database is in UTC, not local time

The `start_ts` column in `statistics` is Unix UTC. SQLite's `datetime(ts, 'unixepoch', 'localtime')` modifier silently does nothing because the HA system is configured to UTC. **All window boundaries must be computed in Australian local time and converted to UTC explicitly.**

Use the timezone from `config.yaml` via `cfg.timezone` (a `ZoneInfo` object). Do not hardcode UTC offsets — DST transitions vary by location and you will get this wrong if you assume one or the other.

### 2. Don't trust the consumed-power sensor if it has a short history

The `solarnet_power_load_consumed` sensor only goes back to July 2024. The config uses `solarnet_power_load` instead — same underlying measurement, sign-flipped (consumption is stored as negative), available from system commissioning. Apply `ABS(mean)` to recover the magnitude.

### 3. Don't compute consumption from integrated power

Hourly mean-power integration introduces 5–15% noise vs the energy balance. Compute `consumption_wh` as:

```text
consumption_wh = solar_wh + grid_import_wh + battery_discharged_wh
               − grid_export_wh − battery_charged_wh
```

This is what the HA Energy Dashboard does internally. Keep the integrated value as `consumption_wh_load` in a separate column for QA only.

### 4. Use the PV-only sensor, not the inverter output sensor

On Fronius systems, `sensor.solar_power` includes battery discharge — not pure PV. The config uses `sensor.solarnet_power_photovoltaics` (instantaneous W; integrate `MAX(mean, 0) × 1h` to get Wh). Check the equivalent on other inverter brands.

### 5. Cumulative-sum sensors: use `sum`, not `state`

The `state` column is the raw meter reading; `sum` is the HA-corrected cumulative value (handles meter resets). Always use `sum`. Window energy = `sum(end) − sum(start)`.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+
- Type hints on all public functions
- `ruff` for lint, `pytest` for tests
- All datetimes are timezone-aware; never use naive datetimes
- SQL parameter binding always (never string interpolation into queries)
- Connect to the HA DB read-only: `sqlite3.connect(f"file:{path}?mode=ro", uri=True)`
- The dataset DB is the project's own SQLite file, separate from the HA DB

## Testing

Three known-good validation fixtures (Feb 7 2026, Mar 20 2026, Jul 17 2025) are documented in `docs/DATASET.md § Validation samples` and encoded in `tests/fixtures.py`. The extraction script must reproduce these values exactly when run against the user's HA database. Tolerances: ±0.1 for percentages and temperatures, ±1 Wh for energies.

A passing run of `pytest` is the bar for any change to extraction logic.

## Incremental behaviour

The extract script must be incremental:

1. On startup, ensure the dataset DB exists (create from `schema.sql` if not).
2. Read `MAX(date) FROM daily_observations`. Default to `2023-11-28` (first complete window after commissioning) if empty.
3. Compute and `INSERT OR REPLACE` rows from `MAX(date) + 1` through yesterday (today's window is incomplete).
4. Update `extraction_meta` with `last_full_extraction = now()`.

Provide a `--rebuild` flag that drops and re-extracts all rows. Useful when methodology changes.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. Update it whenever:

- The dataset schema version changes (new migration added)
- Model coefficients are retrained and updated in `config.yaml`
- A new tool or integration artifact is added
- A significant bug fix lands in extraction or model logic

Add the new entry under `## [Unreleased]` at the top; move it to a dated version heading when tagging a release.

## When in doubt, ask

Don't make these changes without discussion:

- Modifying the schema of `daily_observations`
- Switching to a different source sensor
- Changing how a column is computed
- Adding new "convenience" columns or features that weren't asked for
- Changing the window boundaries

Sensor names come from `config.yaml` — never hardcode them. If a configured sensor is not found in the HA DB, surface a clear error rather than silently substituting.
