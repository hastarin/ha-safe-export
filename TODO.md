# TODO — live test the retrained model + follow-ups

## Done (2026-05-22)

- **Cum-delta window boundary bug — FIXED.** The four cumulative-sum energy columns
  were read over `19:00 prior → 12:00 today` instead of `18:00 prior → 11:00 today`
  (HA stores bucket `T`'s `sum` as the reading at `T+1h`; must read one hour earlier).
  Fixed in `src/extract.py` (`ts_17_prior`/`ts_10_today`), `windows.py` (dropped
  `ts_11_today`), `DATASET.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (new "Cumulative-sum boundary" entry),
  `schema_version` corrected to 1.4.0. Dataset rebuilt; all 3 fixtures re-verified;
  `pytest` green.
- **Model retrained — DONE.** `tools/retrain.py` (new; needs the `tools` numpy extra)
  refit all four zones on 858 trainable nights, held-out validation (every 5th night).
  New coefficients/percentiles/buffers in `config.yaml`, `tests/conftest.py`,
  `tools/predictor.html`, `tools/nodered-flow.json`. Heating R² 0.77→0.83, cooling
  0.37→0.52; P95 buffers shrank (heating 3.562→2.649, cooling 3.136→2.431); held-out
  violation 0.8% heating / 0.0% cooling. `confidence_scale` in `model.py` recomputed
  (negligible drift). See CHANGELOG and the DECISIONS.md retrain/band-review entries.
- **Zone bands reviewed and KEPT at 17/19/21.** The 1°C consumption profile confirmed
  the minimum sits in the warm band (17–19°C) and 19–21°C ("mild") is the low-cooling
  shoulder — so mild > warm is correct, not a bug. Misnomer documented in code +
  DECISIONS.md. Bands unchanged.
- **Three-copy sync rule documented** in CLAUDE.md (model.py/config.yaml,
  predictor.html, nodered-flow.json must stay in sync; redeploy required for the
  Node-RED flow and HTML to take effect).
- **P50 divergence fixed.** The Node-RED flow's confidence buffer-scale ladder now
  matches model.py exactly (`{0.50: 0.33, 0.75: 0.58, 0.90: 0.88, 0.95: 1.00}`;
  previously P50=0.00, P90=0.87). The flow is intended to faithfully mirror the
  canonical model as the stand-in for the eventual HA integration — documented in
  CLAUDE.md. **Re-import the flow into Node-RED to pick up the new coefficients + scales.**

- **Backtest re-run + reworked to the SoC-trough metric (v3) — DONE.** Evaluates against
  the actual overnight trough (`min_soc_overnight`), reconstructing the no-export baseline
  via the new `evening_grid_export_wh` column + full-charge adjustment. "Perfect" drains to
  a soft floor (hard + 10 pts); shortfall charged only for the incremental breach below the
  hard floor. Capacity + floor now read from `config.yaml`. Summary tables sorted by net
  capture descending. New `evening_grid_export_wh` column added (schema 1.5.0, migration
  005, `ts_20_prior`); fixtures + DATASET.md updated; `pytest` green. Resolves the old
  design questions (shortfall metric, actual floor, perfect benchmark, sorting).
- **Node-RED default output switched P90 → P50.** **Re-import the flow into Node-RED to
  deploy.** Deployment confidence stays Open (see DECISIONS.md) — P50 is a live test.

## Now: live test via Node-RED + observe

- **Deploy:** re-import `tools/nodered-flow.json` into Node-RED (it now carries the
  retrained coefficients, aligned confidence scales, and P50 default output). Eyeball the
  first few nights' export vs actual SoC trough.
- **Deployment confidence is Open.** Backtest validated only a 14-day window so far (model
  exported with zero floor breaches; P50 best on net capture but full-period numbers are
  caveated by the full-charge assumption + in-sample baselines). Accumulate real nights
  before locking P50 vs P75.

## Add the SoC-minimum sensor to the dataset (future)

The discharge floor is currently the fixed `config.yaml` `reserve_fraction` (0.10) — fine
for now, since we have **no historical record** of what the floor was per night.

- `sensor.byd_battery_box_premium_hv_soc_minimum` exists in HA but is recorded in
  **short-term `states` only — it has NO long-term statistics** (not in `statistics_meta`),
  so it is not yet usable by the extraction (which reads the `statistics` table).
- **Action:** enable long-term statistics for it in HA (needs a `state_class`), then add a
  per-night floor column to the dataset and have the backtest/model use the actual floor
  instead of the fixed 0.10. Only useful going forward (no backfill possible).

## Later (still deferred)

- **Deployment** of safe-export recommendations targeted for **September 2026** (winter
  Jun–Aug is structurally loss-making). Re-confirm with the backtest.
- **Cooling model** still only ~64 nights (one summer); revisit after a second summer.
